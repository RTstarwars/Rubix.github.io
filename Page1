<h3> 1. The first thing that you have to do is choose a colour.</br>
2. Then look for the center piece that matches that colour and keep it facing up.</br>
3. When you have done that, you must solve the top layer to make a plus sign like shown in the picture.</br>

4. Now match the center pieces of other colours to that of the middle pieces on the top plus. This may seem confusing but just it should look like the picture below.</br>
